# Cryptocurrencies

### Project Description:

* The goals of this project were to prepare a cryptocurrency dataset for a clustering algorithm to determine a classification ultimately using visualization through 3D and 2D scatterplots in Plotly Express.


* Data dimensionality reduction was performed using PCA.


* Clustering algorithm involved finding a K-means of 4, based on the graphed elbow curve of the data.


* Data plots for clustering of cryptocurrencies for ideal use for the company to invest in were visualized with 3D and 2D scatterplots, with the 3D plot yielding more distinctive viewing of the appropriate clusters to which the cryptocurrencies belonged.
